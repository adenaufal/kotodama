Hi, PST here. So far, this is what we’ve gathered and understood about the new algorithm. Please let us know if any of our statements are inaccurate. 😊

Means: In X’s new system, a trend 𝒊𝒔𝒏’𝒕 𝒋𝒖𝒅𝒈𝒆𝒅 𝒃𝒚 𝒕𝒐𝒕𝒂𝒍 𝒏𝒖𝒎𝒃𝒆𝒓 𝒐𝒇 𝒑𝒐𝒔𝒕𝒔 𝒂𝒏𝒚𝒎𝒐𝒓𝒆. The platform now 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘇𝗲𝘀 𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗲𝗱, 𝗳𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗵𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀, and the 𝗾𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗼𝗳 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 over total volume.

In short:
Before, trending was about posting a lot and posting all day.
Now, X cares more about real conversations happening fast.

A topic that suddenly gets lots of people talking at the same time rises to the top. (𝘑𝘶𝘴𝘵 𝘭𝘪𝘬𝘦 𝘸𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘸𝘦 𝘴𝘢𝘸 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘯𝘥 𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘭𝘪𝘦𝘳 — 𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘬𝘦𝘺𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘥 𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘺𝘦𝘥 𝘢𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘵𝘰𝘱 𝘣𝘦𝘤𝘢𝘶𝘴𝘦 𝘯𝘦𝘸 𝘤𝘰𝘯𝘵𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘦𝘯𝘨𝘢𝘨𝘦𝘮𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘸𝘦𝘳𝘦 𝘱𝘰𝘴𝘵𝘦𝘥 𝘴𝘪𝘮𝘶𝘭𝘵𝘢𝘯𝘦𝘰𝘶𝘴𝘭𝘺, 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘭 𝘤𝘰𝘯𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘴𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘴 𝘩𝘢𝘱𝘱𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘥 𝘵𝘩𝘳𝘰𝘶𝘨𝘩𝘰𝘶𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘯𝘥 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘯𝘵.)

Important:
📈 Trends grow faster from sudden spikes in activity, not from many steady posts. ✨
⬆️ Engagement speed > post count
📈 Post counts will only appear if the system decides it is necessary.

Must focus:
✅Post together at the same time
Focus on a 30–60 minute window instead of spreading posts all day. Early momentum matters most.
✅Engage, don’t disappear
Reply, comment, and join conversations. X rewards real interaction, not solo posts.
✅Quote tweets > simple reposts
Add your own opinion or thoughts to generate high-quality engagement.
✅Avoid identical text across the fandom
Keep the structure consistent, but vary your wording. X flags repeated text as spam.
✅Include people outside the fandom
New users joining the conversation boost trend momentum and widen reach.
✅Images, videos, and GIFs need text
Add at least 1–2 sentences so X can understand the content.
✅Small accounts matter too
Even accounts with few followers can help trend if they actively reply and engage.

NOTE: Please be advised that the application will undergo several changes in the coming days or weeks.

On January 17 or 18 X will open-source its entire new recommendation algorithm, revealing exactly how it decides what each user sees. This includes;
How posts go viral; How ads are targeted; How content is promoted or hidden; How the For You feed recommends posts.

And that’s just the start. Every 4 weeks, X will release updated versions with full engineering notes explaining all changes.

So all of the above may change depending on their decisions. For now, let’s focus on learning and familiarizing ourselves with it.

WHAT TO AVOID (HIGH RISK)

- Posting too frequently (every few seconds)
- Copy-paste text
- Empty hashtag posts
- More than 1 hashtag
- Tagging unrelated users
- Mentioning agencies / brands / artists repeatedly (@)

These can cause reach limitation or shadow suppression.

WHAT THE ALGORITHM LOVES

— Real conversations
— Diverse opinions under the same topic
— Many different users, not the same few accounts
— People stopping to read (Unregretted User-Seconds)
— Original content
— Human behavior

Under the new algorithm, the number of posts no longer matters as much in pushing a tag or keyword to the top, which is why post counts are no longer displayed. However, if we still need to track the total number of posts for a hashtag or keyword, we can use third-party tools like Talkwalker.

REMEMBER:

The new X system highlights how hashtags or keywords reach the top of the trend list by focusing on speed, freshness, and real-time interaction. Instead of relying on sheer post volume, the algorithm prioritizes sudden spikes in engagement, meaningful conversations, unique users, and coordinated activity within a short time window.
