description: Run comprehensive checks (types, lint, test, build) to ensure code quality and stability.
---

1. **Type Check**: Run TypeScript compiler to catch type errors.
   ```powershell
   npm run type-check
   ```

2. **Linting**: Check for code style and potential errors.
   ```powershell
   npm run lint
   ```

3. **Testing**: Run the test suite.
   ```powershell
   npm test
   ```

4. **Build Verification**: Ensure the project builds successfully.
   ```powershell
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Fix Issues**: If any of the above steps fail, analyze the errors and fix them before proceeding. Rerunning the specific failing check is recommended after fixes.
